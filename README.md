# Moody Potato ü•îüí≠ 


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Unusables


### Team Members
- Member 1: Dharithry Jyodish - Govt. Model Engineering College, Thrikkakara
- Member 2: Neha Joe - Govt. Model Engineering College, Thrikkakara

### Project Description
Moody Potato is an emotionally unstable, overly dramatic potato that responds to your questions with chaotic overthinking. It also plays games, spirals with you, and gives unhelpful advice just when you need it the most.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People have Google, ChatGPT, and therapy ‚Äî but no one has a potato that dodges life and your cursor at the same time.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a root vegetable that can spiral on command, play games to avoid seriousness, and give emotionally catastrophic advice ‚Äî all in one app. You ask a question, it panics for you.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages: JavaScript
- Framework: React.js
- Libraries: Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- Tools: Vite, Figma (for planning), GitHub

For Hardware:
Potato-level energy only. No actual hardware. Just vibes.

# Schematic & Circuit
![Circuit]
*There is no actual circuit. Just emotional circuitry inside a potato's brain.*

*The schematic represents a loop of spiraling thoughts, triggered by simple questions like ‚ÄúWhat should I eat?‚Äù*

üß∑ Final Build Explanation
The final build of Moody Potato is a chaotic yet polished single-page web app where users interact with a dramatic, emotionally unstable potato. It features:

ü•î "Ask Potato" ‚Äî The core interaction where the potato gives spiraled-overthinking answers to any question you ask.

üò© "Tell Me Something Worse" ‚Äî When life feels bad, the potato reminds you it can always get worse ‚Äî creatively and dramatically.

üéÆ Catch-Me Game ‚Äî The potato dodges your cursor like it‚Äôs dodging responsibilities. Pure chaos. Pure fun.

‚ú® Animations & UI Polish ‚Äî Soft, wiggly, and emotionally rich UI using Tailwind, Framer Motion, and expressive fonts.
